# Chat Log: MERN Backend Project

## 1. Project Setup
- Created a complete MERN backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose)
- Implemented authentication, user management, blog post CRUD, comments, likes, and security middleware
- Added Docker and MongoDB setup, test scripts, and documentation

## 2. Local Testing
- Started MongoDB locally using Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install mongodb-community
  brew services start mongodb-community
  ```
- Started the backend server:
  ```bash
  NODE_ENV=development PORT=5001 MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mern-app JWT_SECRET=test-secret-key JWT_EXPIRE=24h BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12 node server.js
  ```
- Tested endpoints with curl and automated test script:
  ```bash
  npm run test:api
  ```
- Verified health endpoint in browser: [http://localhost:5001/api/health](http://localhost:5001/api/health)

## 3. Manual API Testing
- Registered a user, created a post, fetched posts, all via curl commands
- Example:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "demo_user", ... }'
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/posts -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" -d '{...}'
  curl http://localhost:5001/api/posts
  ```

## 4. GitHub Repository Creation
- Generated a GitHub personal access token
- Initialized git, committed all files
- Created a new public repository via GitHub API
- Added remote and pushed code using the token
- Repository URL: https://github.com/salonabib/mern-backend-api

## 5. Security Note
- Recommended to revoke the GitHub token after use

## 6. Browser Testing
- Health endpoint and posts endpoint can be viewed directly in the browser
- Authenticated endpoints require a REST client (Postman/Insomnia) or curl

## 7. Support
- If you need to add a frontend, CI/CD, or more features, just ask!
